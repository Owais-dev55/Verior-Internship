            At the Times CEO Summit, experts warned that escalating Middle
            Eastern tensions, particularly threats to Iran’s oil infrastructure,
            could lead to oil prices surging past $100/barrel. The FTSE 100
            already fell amid rising oil and defense stocks, while central banks
            reassured markets. The Norwegian central bank has delivered a
            surprise quarter-point cut in interest rate to 4.25 per cent, its
            first reduction of borrowing costs in five years. “Inflation has
            declined since the monetary policy meeting in March and the
            inflation outlook for the coming year indicates lower inflation than
            previously expected,” Ida Wolden Bache, governor of Norges Bank,
            said. The currency and Norwegian government bond yields fell. The
            dollar was up more that 1 per cent against the Norwegian crown.
            Government bond yields fell after the decision by as much as 10
            basis points to 3.95 per cent, the lowest since May.

              After being dropped from Pakistan’s national squad, captain Babar
              Azam has secured a multi-crore contract in Australia’s Big Bash
              League (BBL). The deal reportedly offers him more than what he
              earned in the PSL, marking a significant turnaround in his career
